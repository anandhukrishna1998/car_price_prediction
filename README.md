# Car Price Prediction Web Application and Monitoring System

## Introduction

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a comprehensive Car Price Prediction Web Application and Monitoring System. The system includes components for making predictions, visualizing past predictions, model serving via an API, data ingestion with quality validation, scheduled predictions, and monitoring dashboards.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into several components:

1. **Web Application:**
    - Prediction Page: Allows users to make single or multi predictions using a form or by uploading a CSV file. Utilizes a model API service for predictions.
    - Past Predictions Page: Enables users to visualize past predictions with options to select date range and prediction source.

2. **Model Service (API):**
    - Exposes endpoints for making predictions and retrieving past predictions along with the features used. Utilizes PostgreSQL database for storing predictions and data quality issues.

3. **Database:**
    - PostgreSQL database used for storing model predictions and data quality problems.

4. **Data Ingestion Job:**
    - Simulates continuous data flow by ingesting new data at regular intervals, validating data quality, saving data issues, and generating reports.

5. **Prediction Job:**
    - Executes scheduled predictions on ingested data at regular intervals.

6. **Monitoring Dashboards:**
    - Ingested Data Monitoring Dashboard: Helps the data operations team monitor ingested data problems.
    - Data Drift and Prediction Issues Dashboard: Aids ML engineers and data scientists in detecting model or application issues.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone Repository:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies:

Navigate to each component's directory and follow the instructions below:

- **Web Application:**

    - Ensure Python and required libraries are installed. You can set up a virtual environment if needed.
    - Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    - Configure API endpoints and database connection in `config.py`.

- **Database:**
    - Install and configure PostgreSQL.

- **Data Ingestion Job:**
    - Ensure Python and required libraries are installed. You can set up a virtual environment if needed.
    - Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    - Configure data ingestion settings in `config.py`.

- **Prediction Job:**
    - Ensure Python and required libraries are installed. You can set up a virtual environment if needed.
    - Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    - Configure prediction job settings in `config.py`.

- **Monitoring Dashboards:**
    - Set up Grafana and configure dashboards using provided templates.

### 3. Database Setup:

- Set up a PostgreSQL database as per instructions provided in the `database/README.md`.

### 4. Configuration:

- Configure API endpoints, database connection, and other settings as per your environment. Refer to configuration files in respective components.

### 5. Run Components:

- Start each component (Web Application, Model Service, Data Ingestion Job, Prediction Job) as instructed in their README files.

### 6. Monitoring Dashboards Setup:

- Set up Grafana and configure dashboards using provided templates. Follow instructions in the `monitoring_dashboards/README.md`.

### 7. Deployment:

- Deploy the system components in your preferred environment. Ensure proper security measures are implemented.

## Usage

- Access the Web Application through the provided URL.
- Make predictions using the Prediction Page by filling in the form or uploading a CSV file.
- Visualize past predictions using the Past Predictions Page by selecting date range and prediction source.
- Monitor ingested data quality and model performance through the Monitoring Dashboards.
