About
Car Price Prediction is a machine learning project that utilizes a dataset containing information about various cars such as their make, model, mileage, year of manufacture, and other relevant features. By training machine learning models on this data, the project can predict the selling price of a car based on its features.

Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning techniques.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data.
Building and evaluating machine learning models for regression tasks.
Deployment of the trained model for prediction.
